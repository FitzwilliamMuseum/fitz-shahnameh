When Shah Goshtasp realized that his son Esfandiyar coveted
his throne, he dispatched him to Sistan to bring back Rostam, if
necessary in chains, on the pretext that the hero had not come to pay
homage. Goshtasp was aware of a prophecy that Esfandiyar would be
killed. Esfandiyar sent his son, Bahman, to convey Goshtasp’s
demand. On seeing the massive Rostam roasting an onager, Bahman
realized that his father’s mission might fail and rolled a boulder
down on the hero. Rostam nonchalantly waited until the last moment
and we see him here kicking the boulder aside, while continuing to
cook his meal.

Together with Nos. 33, 34, 35, 36 and 39, this illustration belonged to a splendid copy of the Shahnameh commissioned by Timur’s grandson, Ebrahim Soltan (1394–1435), son of Shah Rokh, c.1430.
