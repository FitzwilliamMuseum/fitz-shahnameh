Rostam, like Hercules, faced many trials, notably the Seven Perils
he encountered in the Caspian province of Mazandaran, while on his
way to rescue King Key Kavus who had been captured by divs
(demons).

This action-filled image shows the third Peril. Rostam's watchful
steed, Rakhsh, had woken his owner twice during the night when he saw
the dragon approaching, but as soon as Rostam opened his eyes, the
dragon disappeared. Here, the dragon appears for the third time, the
hero attacks him and cuts off his head. Rostam is shown in his
emblematic tiger-skin coat and snow-leopard cap.

Together with Nos 33, 35, 36, 38 and 39, this illustration belonged to a splendid copy
of the Shahnameh commissioned by Timur’s grandson, Ebrahim Soltan (1394–1435), son of Shah Rokh, c.1430.
