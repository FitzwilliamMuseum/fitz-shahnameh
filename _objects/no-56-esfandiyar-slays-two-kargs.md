Ferdowsi, Shahnameh  
Turkman Commercial style: Shiraz, 15 January 1475  
Scribe: Soltan ‘Ali  
Opaque watercolour, ink and gold on paper  
Private Collection, III.161, fol. 284r

On his way to release his sisters from Turanian ruler Arjasp in the Brazen Hold,
Esfandiyar encountered Seven Perils — the counterpart of those experienced by
Rostam when he rescued Key Kavus (both paralleling the Labours of Hercules). The first
is the threat posed by two kargs.

In this picture the cloven-hoofed monsters
have a chance resemblance to unicorns, but the faces of wolves. The rendering of gurg,
or ‘wolf’, and karg, or ‘rhinoceros’, is similar in
Persian script. In addition, Persian painters had only a vague idea of the appearance
of the rhinoceros.

This copy of the Shahnameh represents the type of manuscripts
described as ‘Commercial Turkman’, since it was produced for the market
rather than a specific patron.
