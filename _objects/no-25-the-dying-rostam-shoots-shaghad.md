No. 25 The dying Rostam shoots Shaghad
Rashid al-Din, Jami’ al-Tawarikh (‘Compendium of Histories’)  
Il-Khanid: Tabriz, 1314  
Opaque watercolour, ink, gold and silver on paper  
Edinburgh University Library, MS. Or. 20, fol. 15v

In Rostam’s old age his envious brother Shaghad plotted his
death. He had traps dug and set with blades in the hunting grounds
round Kabol. The faithful steed Rakhsh sensed danger and hesitated,
but Rostam urged him on and both of them fell into a pit. This is
depicted on the left. Rostam, who has climbed out and persuaded
Shaghad to bend his bow, shoots an arrow with his last strength
through the tree that Shaghad is hiding behind, killing him, as seen
on the right. The tree’s twisted trunk mirrors the contorted figure
of Rostam’s treacherous brother.

This is one of the earliest Shahnameh illustrations that are precisely datable. Together with Nos. 23, 24 and 26, it belonged not to a Shahnameh
manuscript, but to a copy of the Jami’ al-Tawarikh (‘Compendium of Histories’) that draws on the Shahnameh as one of its sources.
