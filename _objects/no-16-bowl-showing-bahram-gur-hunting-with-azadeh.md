The young prince Bahram Gur is shown hunting with Azadeh, the
slave girl who was a fine musician and ‘his heart’s delight and
desire.’ Azadeh challenged him to demonstrate his skill as a hunter
and, firing successive shots from his bow, to turn a male gazelle
into a female, a female one into a male, and then to pin together the
foot and ear of a third one.

Bahram shot two arrows into the female
deer’s head and cut off the antlers of the male deer with a
double-pointed arrow. He nicked the ear of a third gazelle and
when she raised her foot to scratch it, he pinned foot and ear
together, as can be seen here.

Azadeh attributed his success to demonic powers, an accusation that questioned the prince’s skill,
prowess, and farr — the royal charisma demonstrated
by a successful hunt and indispensible for a legitimate Persian ruler. The
angry Bahram Gur threw her from the camel and trampled her. The bowl
shows two successive episodes, with Azadeh on and off the camel. The
union of a prince and a slave girl was, according to the social
outlook of the Shahnameh, as absurd as Azadeh’s
name, meaning ‘free’ or ‘noble’.
