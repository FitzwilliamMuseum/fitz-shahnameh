This garden scene illustrates a preface to Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh
composed by or for Baysonghor b. Shah Rokh, whose father ruled the Timurid Empire in Persia and Central Asia in the first half of the fifteenth century.

It shows the old poet, garbed in a red coat over a green robe, coming to Ghazni to
acquire the patronage of Soltan Mahmud for his Shahnameh.
Ferdowsi is confronted by Mahmud’s court poets, ‘Onsori, ‘Asjadi
and Farrokhi.

Unwilling to have him join their ranks, they test his
skill as a poet. Ferdowsi delivers a brilliant response — the
moment captured here — and is introduced to Soltan Mahmud, but does
not enjoy his favour for long. This rejection and the court poets’
jealousy may explain why the Shahnameh was nearly forgotten for two centuries after Ferdowsi’s death.
