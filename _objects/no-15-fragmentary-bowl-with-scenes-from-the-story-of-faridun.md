Fritware with colours painted in and over the glaze, mina’i  
Nasser D. Khalili Collection of Islamic Art, POT 875

The inside of this bowl probably depicts the story of Faridun,
though not in standard order. The scene on the top right may show
Faridun’s elder sons, Salm and Tur, leaving through an arched
doorway, after hearing of the king’s generosity to their younger
brother, Iraj.

The bottom right probably shows them murdering Iraj
and in the bottom left a sorrowful Faridun receives his beloved son’s
remains. This delicate fragment is a remarkable example of the mina’i
technique.

The small scenes and their minute figures may have been
modelled on lost manuscript illustrations. Such a fine object was
probably intended for display rather than for practical use.
