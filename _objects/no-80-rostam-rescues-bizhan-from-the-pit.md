As in No. 52, Manizheh has guided Rostam to the pit where her
lover Bizhan is imprisoned. Rostam is about to let down his lasso for
the rescue. The period when this manuscript was made witnessed a
considerable production of single-figure studies of fashionable
people. The curving posture of Manizheh and the companion nearest to
Rostam show the influence of such studies. Their impact is also felt
in the soft rendering of trees and rocks. By contrast, the bold pink
background, signalling intense drama, originated in manuscript
illustration.
