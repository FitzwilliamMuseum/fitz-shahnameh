King Afrasiyab of Turan and his general Barman invaded Iran.
Nowzar of Iran took refuge in Dahistan together with his army
commander, Qaran, whose brother had been killed by Barman. Qaran and
other paladins (champions) launched a night attack behind Turanian lines and
encountered Afrasiyab’s force led by Barman at the White Castle.

Here, we see the armies ready to engage. The Iranians are on the
left, identified by the Safavid taj, the red caps
that project from the turbans of their musicians, while the Turanians, on the
right, wear the black-brimmed, white felt cap of Central Asia.
In the foreground, Qaran pursues Barman, pierces his
cummerbund and unhorses him. The warriors’ accoutrements are
rendered in minute detail. Night is evoked by the deep blue, starry
sky, with a crescent moon that breaks through the clouds.

In its radiant palette, exquisite detail and sophisticated
compositions, the manuscript to which this leaf belonged surpasses
all earlier Persian painting. It was commissioned by Shah Tahmasp
(1524–1576). With its 759 leaves sprinkled with gold and 258
illustrations of unrivalled subtlety, the manuscript involved the
work of numerous artists. Combining the elegant refinement of Timurid
painting of Herat, where Tahmasp had been brought up, with the
Turkman exuberance of Tabriz and Shiraz, it represents a synthesis of
the diverse traditions that were absorbed into early Safavid
painting.

This ‘portable art gallery’ of Safavid painting was
sent as a diplomatic gift to the Ottoman court, probably from Shah
Tahmasp to the Ottoman Sultan Selim II following his succession in
1566.

It remained in the library of the Tokapi Palace in Istanbul
until c.1900. In the 1970s it was dispersed by
Arthur A. Houghton, Jr. and its sumptuous paintings now grace numerous public
and private collections.
