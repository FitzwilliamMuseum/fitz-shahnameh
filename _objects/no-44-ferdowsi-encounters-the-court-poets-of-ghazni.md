Ferdowsi, Shahnameh

Patron: Mohammad Juki b. Shah Rokh  
Opaque watercolour, ink and gold on paper  
London, Royal Asiatic Society, Persian MS 239, fol. 7r

As in No. 1, we see Ferdowsi, the figure closest to the river, in
the garden of Soltan Mahmud and the court poets of Ghazni who are
testing his skills. Their faces betray comic alarm, while Ferdowsiâ€™s
gesture suggests exposition tempered by courtesy. The spaces left
blank in the text above the picture were intended for the names of
the court poets written in ornamental forms. The artist has created a
landscape that is exceptionally lyrical, perhaps a reference to the
entrance to the world of poetry rather than the gardens of Ghazni.

Together with Nos.
45,
46,
47,
48,
49,
50,
53,
54 and
55, this
illustration belonged to a copy of the Shahnameh
made for
Mohammad Juki b. Shah Rokh, brother of Ebrahim Soltan (the patron of
Nos. 33,
34,
35,
36,
38 and
39). Mohammad Juki died before the
manuscript was completed. In the early sixteenth century, it came
into the possession of a later Timurid ruler, Babur, who took it to
India when he founded the Mughal dynasty there.
