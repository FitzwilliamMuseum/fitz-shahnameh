The first evil king, Zahhak, ruled Iran for a thousand years.

In his youth he was guided by Eblis (the Devil) and took advantage of the murder of
his father, the Arab king Merdas. Disguised as a cook, Eblis treated Zahhak to exotic
meat dishes and in return asked to kiss his shoulders. Snakes grew from the site of
the kisses. Zahhak cut them off, but they grew back. Eblis, this time transformed into
a physician, advised the king to feed the snakes daily with the brains of young men.

Here, Zahhak’s courtiers stare at the king’s transformation. Disaffected elements
invite him to seize the throne of Iran from Shah Jamshid. This manuscript was planned
to receive one hundred and fifty-three illustrations, a clear indication of the
patron’s status and wealth.
