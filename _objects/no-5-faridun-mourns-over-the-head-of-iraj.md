King Faridun divided his lands among his three sons. Salm received
Rum (the East Roman world), Tur Turan (Central Asia) and Iraj the
best part of the kingdom, Iran. The envious brothers murdered Iraj and sent his head to
Faridun, provoking centuries-long wars between Iran and Turan. Here, we see
Faridun grieving over Iraj’s head in his beloved son’s garden.

Beside Faridun, two cypress trees, symbolic of youth and grace, are embraced by a flowering prunus.
