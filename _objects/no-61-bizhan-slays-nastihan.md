This scene is from the long episode of the ‘Twelve Champions’,
which involves a series of single combats between Iranian and
Turanian warriors. The encounter between the Iranian Bizhan and the
Turanian Nastihan follows Bizhan’s first successful combat in which
he killed Nastihan’s brother, Human. The Turanians retaliated by
launching a night attack, but Bizhan meets the assault and kills
Nastihan with a blow of his mace. The horsetails hanging from the
bridles, a feature first seen in the late fifteenth century, may have
served as protection against sword slashes. Unlike the earlier
Timurid warriors, neither horses nor riders wear armour.

This image
belonged to a manuscript that was produced in Lahijan at the court of
the local ruler of Gilan, Soltan ‘Ali Mirza Karkiya, who gave
refuge to the young Esma‘il Safavi (1501–1524), the future founder
of the Safavid dynasty. It is illustrated in two distinct styles. The
first resembles works in the Turkman style of late fifteenth-century
northwest Iran. The second, seen in this example, is characterized by
imposing figures with
large heads, which have given the manuscript its nickname, the ‘Big
Head’ Shahnameh.

It is now divided
into two main parts, both in Istanbul, with some forty folios
dispersed in other collections.
