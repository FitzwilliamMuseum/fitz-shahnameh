In the Sasanian period, Hormozd of Iran was concerned by the
threat posed by Saveh, the Turkish ruler of Herat. Through a
prophecy, he was led to Bahram Chubineh, a lord willing and able to
lead the army against Saveh. Bahram Chubineh routed the much larger
Turkish force. Saveh took to flight, but Bahram shot him in the back.
Here, Saveh is shown facing his opponent, rather than fleeing, but he
has clearly met his fate. The rearing of the horses, slightly out of
phase with the rocky horizon that rises and falls like waves behind
them, emphasizes the vigorous action.
