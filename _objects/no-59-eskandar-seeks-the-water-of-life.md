Eskandar (Alexander the Great) was informed that in the Land of
Darkness, where the sun sets, there was a spring of the Water of
Life, which bestowed immortality. He took the prophet Khezr as his
guide, giving him one of two rings that would light up when near
water. Eskandar lost his companion in the darkness.

Khezr found the water and bathed in it, while Eskandar passed on to a mountain where
a talking tree foretold his doom. The artist has employed a pictorial
variant that is more appropriate for the account given in the Khamseh
of Nezami, where Khezr is accompanied by Elyas. Both figures have
flaming halos indicative of their prophetic powers. The differing
paths are clear in the composition: the two prophets focus their
attention downwards to the Water of Life, while Eskandar proceeds
with his eyes fixed on a distant horizon.
