Ferdowsi, Shahnameh

Opaque watercolour, ink and gold on paper  
Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, MS 22-1948, fol. 11v

Jamshid, son of Tahmuras and the fourth Pishdadian king, was
responsible for a great many inventions, from building in brick,
mining and the manufacture of weapons to weaving, wine making and
sailing. From the skin-clad followers of the first Iranian king,
Kiyumars, humanity rose to a great civilization in Jamshid’s time,
celebrated at the festival of Nowruz (New Year), which he
inaugurated.

The ultimate expression of the king’s achievements was
a jewelled throne carried through the air by divs
(demons). Here, the artist has depicted the throne on land, but has
incorporated the demons as well. Jamshid’s pride would lead to his
downfall; he was driven from the throne by the usurper Zahhak.

Together with Nos.
7 and
10,
this illustration belonged to a copy of
the Shahnameh
close in style to that produced for Ebrahim Soltan in Shiraz (Nos.
33,
34,
35,
36,
38 and
39). It may represent the independent efforts of his artists after
his death in 1435 or the work of their pupils.
