After a long battle with Esfandiyar, Rostam was prompted by the Simorgh to shoot his adversary in the eyes with a double-headed arrow
of tamarisk. Esfandiyar fell, but drew out the arrow himself, as his
brother Pashutan and his son Bahman ran to assist him. Esfandiyar
entrusted Rostam with the care for Bahman, although he found out that
the hero had received assistance from the Simorgh. We see Rostam as
he begins to regret and his father Zal who realizes that the hero’s
life will now be darkened. 

The manuscript was presented to King George III or George IV
by the Marquess of Hastings, who had been Governor General in India.
