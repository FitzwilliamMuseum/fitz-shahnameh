As in No. 49, Siyavosh must pass through the fire in order to
prove his innocence against his step-mother’s claim that he had
violated her. With a gesture of prayer and a smile of beatific
confidence, Siyavosh plunges into black smoke so dense that it
obscures the heads of the watchers’ horses. In the crowd his father
seems to anticipate a good outcome, but in the window above his
step-mother, Sudabeh, watches with anxious guilt. The dynamic and
colourful style of this manuscript has been associated with Astarabad
(now Gorgan) in north-eastern Iran.
