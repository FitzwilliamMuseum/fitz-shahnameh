Like No. 36, this image illustrates the tragic story of Rostam
killing his son from Tahmineh, Sohrab. The two met for the first time
on the battle field, where Rostam was fighting for Iran and Sohrab
for Turan. Both refused to reveal their identity. Rostam gave Sohrab
a fatal wound and only then found on his arm the jewel that he had
given to Tahmineh for their child. What we see here is the moment of
realisation. Rostam tears his clothes in anguish. Sohrab’s
expression suggests forgiveness.

In the lower left, the picture is
signed by Mo‘in Mosavver with a date yielding 1649. Mo‘in
Mosavver signed illustrations in at least four Shahnamehs.
This image is from the earliest of them.
