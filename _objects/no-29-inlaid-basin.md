Inlay, a celebrated feature of Persian metalwork, is achieved by hammering metals of
different colour into prepared slots in the body of a metal object;
the inlay is then chased to produce linear details. Here, amidst
elaborate scroll work, a frieze contains riders some of whom are from
the Shahnameh.

The figure on foot is the usurper Zahhak, identifiable by the snakes
growing out of his shoulders as the result of the devil’s kiss. He
is led by Faridun, his over-thrower, who is riding an ox. The Persian
prince Bahram Gur and his harp-playing slave girl Azadeh are also
shown. A pair of riders who hold a ring seem to echo scenes of the
investiture of kings on Sasanian rock carvings in Fars, the region
whose principal city is Shiraz.
