The subject is as Nos. 18, 28, 48 and 75.

Tamineh and her attendant exchange looks as though preparing for her to propose
carrying Rostam’s child. The Persian hero stares up at both of
them, eagerly wondering what prompted their midnight visit. This
scene contains architectural features on the basis of which it can
be attributed to the Sultanate period in India, that
is the time of Muslim rule in north and central India prior to the
coming of the Mughals. The profile of the dome and the fact that it
overhangs its drum suggest production in the North Deccan in India.
