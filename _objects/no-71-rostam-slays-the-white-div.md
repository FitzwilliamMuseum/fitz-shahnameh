As in No. 47, Rostam has defeated the White Div and is
extracting its liver to cure the blindness of Key Kavus. This image
exemplifies a new fashion for the selection of celebrated episodes,
individual figures or small groups for inclusion in albums of
drawings and paintings: the traditional two-figure group has been
changed from a horizontal to a vertical position. Persian painting on
silk is known from c.1400 and tends to be
associated with Tabriz or Herat. The Shahnameh records that silk was the normal support for letters exchanged between sovereigns.
