After visiting the Ka‘ba, Eskandar (Alexander the Great) led
his troops to Egypt. Queen Qeydafeh of Andalus (Candace of Meroë) sent a
spy to make a portrait of him. Eskandar came to Qeydafeh’s
court disguised as his ambassador, but the queen recognised him and
he had to admit his true identity. The illustration departs from the
text.

One would expect to see Qeydafeh enthroned with Eskandar’s
portrait and Eskandar himself seated at a lower level. Instead, the
painting shows Eskandar on the throne and no Qeydafeh — unless we
imagine that she is looking through our eyes, the eyes of the
viewers.

The image of Eskandar has been interpreted as a posthumous
portrait of Shah ‘Abbas I. The kneeling figure who extends a hand
towards him may be the manuscript’s patron, Qarajaghay Khan.

The volume was presented to Queen Victoria in 1839 by Kamran Shah of
Herat.
