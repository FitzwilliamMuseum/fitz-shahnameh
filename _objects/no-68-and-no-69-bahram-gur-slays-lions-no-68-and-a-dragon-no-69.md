These are two of the twenty-four illustrations that survive
from a
manuscript dated 1580. The work of several artists, they combine
stylistic elements from Mashhad (eastern Iran) and Qazvin (western
Iran).

In No. 68, Bahram Gur, who has recently ascended the throne of
Iran, rides into a wood and confronts the lions there. The hunting of
lions was the archetypical sport of Persian kings, and — perhaps
unwittingly — the painter echoes a motif found on Sasanian silver
dishes.

In No. 69 we see Bahram Gur, on a majestic white steed,
killing a fire-breathing dragon for the Shangal of Hind (India). The
tree branches seem to flicker, echoing the dragon’s sinuous
movement. The grotesque profiles in the rock, a feature appearing
from the fourteenth century onwards, may represent spirits, or djinn,
while amusing the artist and viewer.
