Having proved his innocence against his stepmother᾿s
accusation, Siyavosh volunteered to repel an incursion by Turan. But a dream warned
Afrasiyab that he would meet his doom if he fought Siyavosh and they
came to an agreement, which enraged Key Kavus. Torn between his
agreement and his duty to his father, Siyavosh went into exile in
Turan. He was well received and was able to display his skills,
including his prowess at polo in a match against Afrasiyab — shown
here.

The nineteenth century saw a revival of figurative tilework,
with advanced pictorial effects. There is a hint of distant landscape
and the suggestion of shading in this tile. It is signed in the upper
border by Mohammad Ebrahim, who is perhaps to be identified with one
Ostad Ebrahim Kashani, known from a single tile in a private
collection.
