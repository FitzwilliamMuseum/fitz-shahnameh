Esfandiyar, son of Goshtasp of Iran, went to the Brazen Hold
to free his sisters who had been abducted by Arjasp of Turan. Disguised
as a merchant, he entered Arjasp’s fortress, found his sisters,
signalled to his army outside to attack the castle, and slayed
Arjasp. This extraordinary bird’s eye view distances the main
action, while the intricate web of architecture frames and holds it
in focus. The tile cartouche above the door reads ‘Mohammad Juki bahador
(warrior)’, the name of the patron of this manuscript.

Together with Nos. 44, 45,46,47, 48, 49, 50, 53 and 54, this illustration belonged to a copy of the Shahnameh
made for Mohammad Juki b. Shah Rokh, brother of Ebrahim Soltan (the
patron of Nos. 33, 34, 35, 36, 38 and 39).

Mohammad Juki died before
the manuscript was completed. In the early sixteenth century, it came
into the possession of a later Timurid ruler, Babur, who took it to
India when he founded the Mughal dynasty there.
