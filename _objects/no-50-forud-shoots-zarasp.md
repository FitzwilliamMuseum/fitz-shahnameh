After his fire ordeal, Siyavosh went into exile and was
murdered
on the order of the Turanian king, Afrasiyab. Key Khosrow, the son of
Siyavosh and King Afrasiyab’s daughter, returned to Iran as prince
and decided to avenge the murder of his father. He sent
an army to Turan, instructing them to avoid the castle of his
half-brother, Forud. But the army commander, Tus, approached the
castle and when Forud offered to join the avenging army, Tus attacked
him. Here, we see Forud shooting Tus’s son Zarasp. Forud’s
dramatic posture exploits the fact that the Persian bow was drawn
with the thumb. As Zarasp crumples, his horse also feels the shot and
strives to maintain its balance. The banner on the lower right may
allude to the Persian royal flag, described as violet in the
Shahnameh.

this illustration belonged to a copy of the Shahnameh
made for Mohammad Juki b. Shah Rokh, brother of Ebrahim Soltan (the
patron of Nos.
33,
34,
35,
36,
38 and
39).

Mohammad Juki died before
the manuscript was completed. In the early sixteenth century, it came
into the possession of a later Timurid ruler, Babur, who took it to
India when he founded the Mughal dynasty there.
