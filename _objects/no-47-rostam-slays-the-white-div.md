Ferdowsi, Shahnameh  
Timurid: Herat, c.1444  
Patron: Mohammad Juki b. Shah Rokh  
Opaque watercolour, ink and gold on paper  
London, Royal Asiatic Society, Persian MS 239, fol. 44r
{: .text-info }

King Key Kavus was captured and blinded by divs in Mazandaran. Rostam set him free, but to cure his blindness he needed the White Div’s liver. The battle with the White Div in its lair — the cave shown in section here — was Rostam’s seventh
and final Peril. Rostam’s enforced guide, Owlad, who is tied to a tree, looks exceedingly anxious.

The hero, wearing his habitual tigers-skin coat, is removing the liver while the demon grasps his dismembered arm in anguish. The depiction of the div shows influence
from China or Central Asia.

Together with Nos.
44,
45,
46,
48,
49,
50,
53,
54 and
55,
this illustration belonged to a copy of the
Shahnameh
made for Mohammad Juki b. Shah Rokh, brother of Ebrahim Soltan (the
patron of Nos.
33,
34,
35,
36,
38 and
39).

Mohammad Juki died before
the manuscript was completed. In the early sixteenth century, it came
into the possession of a later Timurid ruler, Babur, who took it to
India when he founded the Mughal dynasty there.
