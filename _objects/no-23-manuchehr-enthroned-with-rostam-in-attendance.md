Rashid al-Din, Jami’ al-Tawarikh (‘Compendium of Histories’)  
Il-Khanid: Tabriz, 1314  
Opaque watercolour, ink, gold and silver on paper  
Edinburgh University Library, MS. Or. 20, fol. 6

In this illustration, the youthful Manuchehr is centrally
enthroned and juxtaposed with the maturing warrior Rostam seated on
the left. The painting does not illustrate a specific incident in the
Shahnameh  and Rostam is not even mentioned in the text, though he was born in the
reign of Manuchehr.

The style of pen drawing and the limited use of
colour owe much to Chinese work. Chinese and Mongol styles are also
evident in the feet and finials of the throne, the scale pattern on
the scabbard, and the gadrooned basin in the foreground. Recent
conservation has largely reversed the effects of oxidization in
silver used for highlights.

This is one of the earliest Shahnameh
illustrations that are precisely datable. It belonged not to a
Shahnameh manuscript, but to a copy of the Jami’ al-Tawarikh
(‘Compendium of Histories’) that draws on the Shahnameh
as one of its sources. The scholar-statesman Rashid al-Din compiled
his work in Tabriz. In order to demonstrate the position of the
Mongols and their subject peoples in world history (as understood at
the time), he included accounts of the Buddha and of the Prophet
Mohammad.

24, 25 and 26.
