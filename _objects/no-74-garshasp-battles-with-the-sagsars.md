The Garshaspnameh, ‘The Book of Garshasp’, composed in 1066, is one of the works
that developed the earlier or later stories of Shahnameh
characters. Garshasp, who lived in the time of
Zahhak, was Rostam’s great-great uncle. He is here depicted visiting the island
of Qalun, where the blue-bodied sagsars
(‘dog-heads’), excellent horsemen skilled in warfare, devoured
their defeated opponents. This courtly manuscript was produced in
Qazvin, Iran’s capital in the second half of the sixteenth century.

It contains the names of several painters. Here, between the
(right-hand) first and second lower columns, we see the signature of
Sadeqi, a warrior, courtier, man of letters and artist of Turkman
descent.
