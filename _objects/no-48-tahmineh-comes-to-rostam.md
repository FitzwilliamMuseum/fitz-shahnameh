The scene of Tahmineh visiting Rostam at night with the request to bear
his child is one of the most frequently illustrated episodes in the
Shahnameh (see Nos. 18 and 28).

Rostam’s enthusiasm and Tahmineh’s bashfulness make this is one of the most delightful versions. The exquisite rendering of a princely interior transports the viewer into
the fifteenth century. Tahmineh is no longer attended by a woman but
by a black eunuch, perhaps reflecting a change in contemporary
custom.

The depiction of the div shows influence from China or Central Asia.

Together with Nos.44,45,46,47,49,50,53,54 and55,this illustration belonged to a
copy of the Shahnameh made for Mohammad Juki b. Shah Rokh, brother of Ebrahim Soltan (the patron of Nos.33,34,35,36,38 and 39).

Mohammad Juki died before the manuscript was completed. In the early sixteenth century, it came into the possession of a later Timurid ruler, Babur, who took it to
India when he founded the Mughal dynasty there.
