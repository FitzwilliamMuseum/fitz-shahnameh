As in Nos. 18,28 and 48, we see Tahmineh, the daughter of the
ruler of Samangan, approaching Rostam in the middle of the night with
the request to bear his child. Here, Tahmineh is a shy figure,
allotted a single column width, while her attendant receives two.
Rostam’s face has been re-drawn, and an owner’s seal stamped on
his coverlet. The copying of this manuscript has previously been
attributed to Sultanate India in the fifteenth century, but the
presentation of the script in a cloud outline and the high-heeled
boots of the attendant support a later date. The presence of other
illustrations in the manuscript in a pastiche of fourteenth century
Il-Khanid style is a further indication of a deliberate art
historical reference to the past.
