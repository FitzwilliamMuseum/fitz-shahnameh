This image illustrates one of the most famous and tragic episodes in the Shahnameh.

Unaware of his opponent’s identity, Rostam kills his son Sohrab.
Tahmineh’s son had grown up knowing that Rostam was his father, but
the two have never met until they found themselves fighting on
opposing sides in a battle between Iran and Turan. With matching
stubbornness they refused to reveal their identity to each other.
Rostam delivered a deadly blow, but on opening Sohrab’s clothing he
found the jewel that he had given to Tahmineh for their child.

Together with Nos. 33,34, 35, 38 and 39, this illustration belonged to a splendid copy of the Shahnameh commissioned by Timur’s grandson, Ebrahim Soltan (1394–1435), son of Shah Rokh, c.1430.
