Sam had long been childless, but when an albino son was born to him he
abandoned him in the Alborz mountain to die, because of his perceived
defect. The Simorgh, a mythical bird, took the infant to her nest and
brought him up. Years later, Sam had a dream about his son and set
out to find him, but could not reach the mountain top. The Simorgh
gave the boy feathers that he could burn to summon her at need and
carried him down to his father. Overjoyed, Sam named his son Zal
(‘white-haired’).

As usual, Zal is shown here as an infant rather
than the boy described in the Shahnameh.
The rendering of the Simorgh derives from Chinese versions of the
Asiatic pheasant. The colourful rocks lend a magical quality to the
mountains.

this illustration belonged to a copy of the Shahnameh
made for Mohammad Juki b. Shah Rokh, brother of Ebrahim Soltan (the
patron of Nos.

36,
38 and
39).
Mohammad Juki died before the manuscript was completed. In the early sixteenth century, it came
into the possession of a later Timurid ruler, Babur, who took it to
India when he founded the Mughal dynasty there.
