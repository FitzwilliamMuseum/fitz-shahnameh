This striking miniature of a stone horseman illustrates the
battle between Rostam and the King of Mazandaran, a master-sorcerer of
demons, who refused to pay tribute to King Key Kavus. Just as Rostam
was about to spear his chest, the sorcerer transformed himself into a
rock — the moment captured here. Rostam puts his finger to his lips
in amazement and Rakhsh bites the stone horse in disbelief. But
Rostam was able to carry the massive stone to Key Kavus’s camp,
where the sorcerer resumed his normal shape and was executed. The
petrified king is normally shown as a round boulder. This portrayal
of an equestrian statue is unusually elaborate. The two slanting
segments of the horizon bear down on the sorcerer, suggesting his
defeat. In the more spacious half of the composition, Rostam’s
lance, the instrument of his victory, soars up and out of the
picture, its pennant fluttering triumphantly.

Together with Nos. 33, 34, 36, 38 and 39, this illustration belonged to a splendid copy of the Shahnameh commissioned by Timur’s grandson, Ebrahim Soltan (1394–1435), son of Shah Rokh, c.1430.
