As in No. 42, Key Kavus has been tempted to take to the skies
in a throne powered by eagles. Astrologers, mentioned briefly in the text
as replying to a question from the king, are given a considerable
importance in this image. It is as though science were taking over
from legend. The picture, which has been set into 16th-century
margin paper at some point, probably dates to the early 19th
century. This is suggested by the soft treatment of the landscape and
the presence of the chupan, the straight-cut, long-sleeved coat worn over the shoulders by two attendants, which was characteristic of the nineteenth century and is
still worn in Afghanistan today.
