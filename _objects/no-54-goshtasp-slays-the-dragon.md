Ferdowsi, Shahnameh  
Timurid: Herat, c.1444  
Patron: Mohammad Juki b. Shah Rokh  
Opaque watercolour, ink and gold on paper  
London, Royal Asiatic Society, Persian MS 239, fol. 250v

Goshtasp, son of Lohrasp of Iran, asked to succeed his father,
but his wish was denied. He travelled to India and then to Rum (Rome or
Byzantium), where he fell in love with and married a daughter of the
Qeysar (Caesar). He helped two noblemen marry other daughters of the
Qeysar by killing a karg
(rhino-wolf) and as seen here a dragon in their place.

Goshtasp is placed partially outside the pictorial space on a
blue rock that bursts through the framed boundaries and
enhances the dynamics of the scene. The dragon slithers across the
page, its pinkish body paralleled by the curve of the large tree in
the background.

Together with Nos.

50,

55,
this illustration belonged to a copy of the Shahnameh
made for Mohammad Juki b. Shah Rokh, brother of Ebrahim Soltan (the patron
of Nos.
33,
34,
35,
36,
38 and
39).

Mohammad Juki died before the
manuscript was completed. In the early sixteenth century, it came
into the possession of a later Timurid ruler, Babur, who took it to
India when he founded the Mughal dynasty there.
