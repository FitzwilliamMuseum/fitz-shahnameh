Compiled in the later thirteenth century, the ‘Aja’eb
al-Makhluqat, or ‘Wonders of Creation’, resembles an encyclopaedia of cosmology
and the natural world. Heroes of the Shahnameh
are included in some copies, such as this late fifteenth-century
example, where Rostam is mentioned eighth in a list beginning with
Faridun. There is no mention in the text of any particular feat, but
Rostam’s habitual ability to unseat an opponent with his spear is
emphasized and illustrated here.
