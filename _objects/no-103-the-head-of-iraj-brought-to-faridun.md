Faridun has prepared to celebrate the return of his beloved
son Iraj, but a camel-rider arrives with a golden casket containing the
prince’s head. Faridun can hardly believe that his son is dead
until the casket is opened, as depicted here. Grandly dressed,
Faridun assimilates the terrible news in silence, while an attendant
respectfully lifts the head on to a dish. Faridun carries the
head into Iraj’s favourite garden (No. 5).

This picture is from the same manuscript as No. 102, but its sombre tonality contrasts
markedly with the gaiety of Jamshid shooting the dove.
