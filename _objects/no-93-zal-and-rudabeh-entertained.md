‘Owfi, Javami‘ al-Hekayat (‘Compendium of Tales’)  
Sultanate India: probably October-November 1439  
Opaque watercolour, ink and gold on paper  
London, British Library, MS Or. 11676, fol. 46r
{: .text-info }


This collection of stories culled from the Shahnameh
and from Islamic history was completed by ‘Owfi for al-Jonaydi,
vizier to Iltotmesh, ruler of the Delhi Sultanate (1211–1236). The
present passage offers a rapid précis of the story of Rostam’s
parents, Zal and Rudabeh. Their depiction in a garden does not derive
directly from the Shahnameh.
Rather, it is a symbol of the triumph of true love. The colourful
objects in the lower left appear to be shaded candles, as seen in
Persian painting from the Jalayerid period, dating to c.1400.
This and the white head-coverings worn by female attendants suggests Persian
influence received through Yazd rather than Shiraz.
