The story of Alexander the Great, called Eskandar in the
Shahnameh, is an important chapter in the epic. On
his way
from India to North Africa he made a stop in Mecca, which may
be seen as a rite of passage in his long journey towards
self-discovery. Eskandar paid his respects to the Ka‘ba, the
House of Abraham, which Ferdowsi describes, as ‘the
place of worship before any others existed … where God causes you to
worship and to remember him.’ Here, Eskandar
watches as a pilgrim reaches for the door handle of the Ka‘ba; in
later versions Eskandar himself is depicted as a pilgrim.
