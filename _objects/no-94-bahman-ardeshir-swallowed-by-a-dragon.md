At the outset of the prose epic Darabnameh,
Bahman, son of Esfandiyar and known as Ardeshir, rules in Iran. He is
told that a dragon has appeared in the mountains and is causing havoc
with the herds. He goes alone to deal with the threat and suddenly
the fire-breathing dragon emerges and swallows him. This is the only
incident in which a monster triumphs over a hero, and it may
represent the mythologized version of a political event. This
extraordinary image was produced at a significant moment in the
development of Mughal painting, when Persian, Hindu and European
artistic styles converged. It could be associated with the visit of a
Jesuit mission, which brought European pictures, to the emperor Akbar
(1156–1605) at Fathpur Sikri in 1580.
