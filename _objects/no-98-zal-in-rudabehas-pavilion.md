Ferdowsi, Shahnameh  
Persian, 15th century (text), Mughal  lacquer covers and Mughal Sub-imperial style (illustration), renovation probably made for ‘Abd al-Rahim, Khankhanan, c.1616  
Painter: Qasem  
Opaque watercolour, ink and gold on paper  
London, British Library, MS Add. 5600, fol. 42v

Zal has climbed to Rudabeh’s pavilion by means of his lasso.
They express their love for each other. Eventually, their parents and
overlord will agree to their marriage, and they will become the
parents of the hero Rostam. The couple is framed in a pavilion at the
side of the picture and the viewer observes them as though from a
distance, imparting a sense of romantic seclusion to the image.

The illustrations in this manuscript are associated with the names of
painters — Qasem seen here on the lower right — who worked for
the Mughal courtier and bibliophile, ‘Abd al-Rahim. This, together
with the date 1616 noted on fol. 274r, justifies the
attribution of the manuscript’s renovation to his patronage.
