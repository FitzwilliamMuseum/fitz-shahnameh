As in No. 18, Rostam is approached by Tahmineh, the daughter
of the King of Samagan in whose castle the hero is spending the night.
Tahmineh, presumably the lady on the right (the other lady is her
attendant), is a determined figure. The inclusion of an exterior
brick wall enhances the notion that the spectator is getting a
glimpse into an intimate scene. The candle that rises into the lines
of text is suggestive of Rostam’s response.
