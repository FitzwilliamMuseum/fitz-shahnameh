No. 14 Bowl with lustre decoration 
Kashan style, 13th century  
Fritware painted in lustre  
Nasser D. Khalili Collection of Islamic Art, POT 1563

While the bowl’s exterior lustre decoration is modest, its
inside contains a complex freeform geometrical pattern. In the centre
lies a six-point star with drop-shape units containing birds or
animals in the interstices. The finials proceeding from the drops may
derive from manuscript illumination. Verses run between these
finials. Two from the Shahnameh read:

>‘Partake of what you have, then give away. Give not your
hard-won to your enemy’

or possibly:

> ‘Are you distressed? Blame
not your enemy.’

The former translation seems more plausible, given the likely use of the bowl in a hospitable setting.
