We see the young Rostam giving an early sign of his heroic
future. His grandfather Sam is visiting and after the celebration Rostam goes
to bed intoxicated. He is woken by shouts that a white elephant has
run wild. Rostam overcomes the elephant with a blow from his
grandfather’s mace and returns to bed. Rostam’s coat is kirtled
into his belt in a way seen in Shah Tahmasp’s Shahnameh (No. 64),
while the turban worn by the mahout of the elephant suggests
knowledge of contemporary Mughal costume under the emperor Akbar
(1556–1605).
