Eskandar, or Alexander the Great, went into the Land of
Darkness
to seek the Water of Life, but failed to find it. Here, he sends his
horse forward into the swirling darkness. His followers look anxious
and even two of the horses stare at each other, uncertain of what
they are about to encounter. The flame-like protuberances on
Eskandar’s helmet probably allude to his identification with the
qur’anic figure Dhu’l-Qarnayn (‘Lord, or Possessor, of Two Horns’).

This is one of the earliest Shahnameh illustrations that are precisely datable. Together with Nos. 23, 24 and 25, it belonged not to a Shahnameh manuscript, but to a copy of the Jami’ al-Tawarikh (‘Compendium of Histories’) that draws on the Shahnameh
as one of its sources.
