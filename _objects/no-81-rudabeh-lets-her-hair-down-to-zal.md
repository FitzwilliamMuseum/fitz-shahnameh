Zal and Rudabeh fell in love before they met. Rudabeh’s
maidens suggested to Zal that he should scale the castle where she lived.
Rudabeh let down her hair to help him ascend. Zal kissed her tresses
and used his lasso instead. Rudabeh took him to her pavilion where
they could plight their troth. Though the action should take place at
night, the artist presents an airy day-time scene. Rudabeh and her
maidens look fondly down on Zal. This may be an early work by the
painter Mo‘in Mosavver (see Nos.
82 and 84).
