Rashid al-Din, Jami’al-Tawarikh  
(‘Compendium of Histories’)  
Il-Khanid: Tabriz, 1314

Like No. 9, this image depicts Key Khosrow’s successor, Lohrasp,
enthroned. Here we see figures characteristic of the Il-Khanid court:
young attendants wear split-brimmed Mongol caps with their hair in
bunches, while old, bearded figures with aquiline profiles have
turbans. The latter have long written scrolls and pen-boxes. 
They are Persian bureaucrats, indispensable to the running of the
empire. The lotus decoration on the throne back is typical for the
period.

This is one of the earliest Shahnameh
illustrations that are precisely datable. Together with Nos. 23,
25 and 26, it belonged not to a Shahnameh
manuscript, but to a copy of the Jami’
al-Tawarikh
(‘Compendium of Histories’) that draws on the Shahnameh
as one of its sources.
