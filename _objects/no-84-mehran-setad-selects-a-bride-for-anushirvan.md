In the days of the Sasanian ruler Anushirvan, the Khaqan of Chin
was intent on territorial expansion, but then decided to offer
Anushirvan one of his daughters in marriage. We see the wise
statesman Mehran Setad, whom Anushirvan sent to make the selection,
meeting four princesses, all beautifully adorned daughters of
concubines, and a fifth one, simply dressed and modest in demeanour,
who is the queen’s daughter. He is able to detect the true
princess, presumably the lady second from the left who is not wearing
a tiara and whose hair does not stray across her cheek. The signature
of the artist, Mo‘in Mosavver, can be seen beneath the picture.
